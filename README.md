ColourClock
===========

Trivial code to control a LimitlessLED/Easybulb/Milight according to the time.

Currently it sets the colour according to the minute of the hour, so 13:01 will be violet (i.e., near ultraviolet) and 13:59 will be red (i.e., near infrared). 

Abandoned for the time being since the bulb control doesn't seem reliable enough. It's quite jarring when it goes from a gentle green at 33 minutes past the hour to 100% brightness white.
